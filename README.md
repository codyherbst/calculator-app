## 2. The calculator must be Object Oriented, utilizing `Class`, not Object.prototype
## 3. The app should be completely rendered via JS, no HTML besides a `<div id="app">`
## 4. The calculator should have a display area at the top.
## 5. The display should show `0` by default.
## 6. The calculator should have 6 function buttons:
    1. Division `/`
    2. Multiplication `*`
    3. Subtraction `-`
    4. Addition `+`
    5. Calculate `=`
    6. Clear `c`
## 7. The calculator should have 10 number buttons, `0-9`.
## 8. The calculator should have a decimal button `.`
## 9.  The display area should update as a user presses buttons.
## 10.  When the user clicks a function button after the first and second values are entered (instead of `=`), the result of the calculation should be saved and the calculator should allow for a new number inp(for example: `1` then + then `3` then `-`, etc.)
## 11.  When the calculate button `=` is pressed, the calculator should apply the operation to the two stored numbers in the appropriate order (important for subtraction and division) and update the display.
## 12.  When the clear button `c` is pressed, all stored data should be erased and the display should show `0` again.
